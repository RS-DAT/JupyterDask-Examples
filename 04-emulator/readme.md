There are two notebooks created for running a machine learning prediction
problem on two datasets with different size. Depending on the infra e.g. SURF
research cloud, or Snellius, the I/O paths and reading, writing files can be
different.

Big data is only available on snellius at
`/gpfs/work2/0/ttse0619/DAT_data` whereas Small data on dcache.
